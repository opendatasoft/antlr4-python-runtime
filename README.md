__A stub package for antlr4 python runtime that requires the correct python version__

This is a simpler helper package for transitioning from python 2 to 3.

__Warning__
the code generated by antlr is different in python 2 and 3 so you will need to generate both in your codebase if the code is not generated on demand.

This repository will probably have a short life, except it to disappear without real notice.
You are of course welcome to fork it if you find it useful.
